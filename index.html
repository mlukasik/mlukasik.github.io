      Since late October 2016 until February 2017, I was a research intern at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Germany. I was working on maximizing visibility in social networks using submodular optimization under supervision of <a href=http://www.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/index.html>Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez</a>.

I currently work in Google Research, New York. 
Before, I was PhD student at the University of Sheffield, Department of Computer Science, working in the Natural Language Processing Research Group, under supervision of <a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tcohn/index.html" target="_blank">Trevor Cohn</a> and <a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~kalina/" target="_blank">Kalina Bontcheva</a>. My <a href="http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/19545/1/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">PhD thesis</a> is about probabilistic modeling of rumours in social media.<br />

<p>
I am interested in deep learning applications, including NLP and deep retrieval.
