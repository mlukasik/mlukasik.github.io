      Online social networks provide a platform for sharing information at an unprecedented scale. Users generate information which propagates across the network resulting in information cascades. In this paper, we study the evolution of information cascades in Twitter using a point process model of user activity. We develop several Hawkes process models considering various properties including conversational structure, users’ connections and general features of users including the textual information, and show how they are helpful in modeling the social network activity. We consider low-rank embeddings of users and user features, and learn the features helpful in identifying the influence and susceptibility of users. Evaluation on Twitter data sets associated with civil unrest shows that incorporating richer properties improves the performance in predicting future activity of users and memes

    abstract: >
      The common approach in morphological analysis of dendritic spines of mammalian neuronal cells is to categorize spines into subpopulations based on whether they are stubby, mushroom, thin, or filopodia shaped. The corresponding cellular models of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression associate the synaptic strength with either spine enlargement or spine shrinkage. Although a variety of automatic spine segmentation and feature extraction methods were developed recently, no approaches allowing for an automatic and unbiased distinction between dendritic spine subpopulations and detailed computational models of spine behavior exist. We propose an automatic and statistically based method for the unsupervised construction of spine shape taxonomy based on arbitrary features. The taxonomy is then utilized in the newly introduced computational model of behavior, which relies on transitions between shapes. Models of different populations are compared using supplied bootstrap-based statistical tests. We compared two populations of spines at two time points. The first population was stimulated with long-term potentiation, and the other in the resting state was used as a control. The comparison of shape transition characteristics allowed us to identify the differences between population behaviors. Although some extreme changes were observed in the stimulated population, statistically significant differences were found only when whole models were compared

      Rumour stance classification, the task that determines if each tweet in a collection discussing a rumour is supporting, denying, questioning or simply commenting on the rumour, has been attracting substantial interest.  Here we introduce a novel approach that makes use of the sequence of transitions observed in tree-structured conversation threads in Twitter. The conversation threads are formed by harvesting users’ replies to one another, which results in a nested tree-like structure. Previous work addressing the stance classification task has treated each tweet as a separate unit. Here we analyse tweets by virtue of their position in a sequence and test two sequential classifiers, Linear-Chain CRF and Tree CRF, each of which makes different assumptions about the conversational structure.  We experiment with eight Twitter datasets, collected during breaking news,  and show that exploiting the sequential structure of Twitter conversations achieves significant improvements over the non-sequential methods.  Our work is the first to model Twitter conversations as a tree structure in this manner, introducing a novel way of tackling NLP tasks on Twitter conversations.

      Classification of temporal textual data sequences is a common task in various domains such as social media and the Web. In  this  paper  we  propose  to  use  Hawkes Processes   for   classifying   sequences   of temporal textual data, which exploit both temporal and textual information. Our experiments on rumour stance classification on four Twitter datasets show the importance of using the temporal information of tweets along with the textual content.

      The aim of this paper is to investigate suitable  evaluation  strategies  for  the  task  of word-level quality estimation of machine translation.    We  suggest  various  metrics to replace F1-score for the “BAD” class, which  is  currently  used  as  main  metric. We compare the metrics’ performance on real system outputs and synthetically generated datasets and suggest a reliable alternative to the F1-BAD score — the multiplication of F1-scores for different classes. Other  metrics  have  lower  discriminative power and are biased by unfair labellings.

      Time series modeling is an important problem with many applications in different domains. Here we consider discriminative  learning  from  time  series,  where  we  seek  to  predict an output response variable based on time series input. We develop a method based on convolution kernels to model discriminative learning over streams of text. Our method outperforms competitive baselines in three synthetic and two real datasets, rumour frequency modeling and popularity prediction tasks.

      Social media is a rich source of rumours and  corresponding  community  reactions. Rumours  reflect  different  characteristics, some shared and some individual. We formulate  the  problem  of  classifying  tweet level  judgements  of  rumours  as  a  supervised learning task.  Both supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation are considered, in which tweets from a rumour are classified on the basis of other annotated rumours.  We demonstrate how multi-task learning helps achieve good results on rumours from the 2011 England riots.

      Research on modeling time series text corpora has typically focused on predicting what text will come next, but less well studied is predicting when the next text event will occur. In this paper we address the latter case, framed as modeling continuous inter-arrival times under a log-Gaussian Cox process, a form of inhomogeneous Poisson process which captures the varying rate at which the tweets arrive over time. In an application to rumour modeling of tweets surrounding the 2014 Ferguson riots, we show how interarrival times between tweets can be accurately predicted, and that incorporating textual features further improves predictions.

      Rumours on social media exhibit complex temporal patterns. This paper develops a model of rumour prevalence using a point process, namely a log-Gaussian Cox process, to infer an underlying continuous temporal probabilistic model of post frequencies. To generalize over different rumours, we present a multi-task learning method parametrized by the text in posts, to allow data statistics to be shared between groups of similar rumours. Our experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several strong baseline methods for rumour frequency prediction evaluated on tweets from the 2014 Ferguson riots

      Author name disambiguation allows to distinguish between two or more authors sharing the same name. In a previous paper, we have proposed a name disambiguation framework in which for each author name in each article we build a context consisting of classification codes, bibliographic references, co-authors, etc. Then, by pair wise comparison of contexts, we have been grouping contributions likely referring to the same people. In this paper we examine which elements of the context are most effective in author name disambiguation. We employ linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) to find the most influential features
