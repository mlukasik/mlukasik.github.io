  <h3>About</h3>
</div>
I am a PhD student at the University of Sheffield, Department of Computer Science, working in the Natural Language Processing Research Group, under supervision of <a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tcohn/index.html" target="_blank">Trevor Cohn</a> from the University of Melbourne, Australia and <a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~kalina/" target="_blank">Kalina Bontcheva</a> from the University of Sheffield, UK. I also collaborate with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pksrijith/home">P.K. Srijith</a> from IIT Hyderabad, India. <br />

  <h4>PhD topic</h4>
I am working on rumour detection and propagation in social media. Rumours are spreading quickly through social media. Authorities may be interested in interpreting and acting upon rumours in order to prevent their spread.
</p>
<p>
Some of the questions I am trying to answer in my PhD work are:
<a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P15/P15-2085.pdf">can rumours' spread be predicted?</a> 
<a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-2064.pdf">Can we estimate when the tweets about rumours will arrive?</a>
<a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/D/D15/D15-1311.pdf">Can a community support around rumours be estimated?</a>
</p>
<p>
During my PhD I have also looked at other problems: <a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tcohn/papers/aaai2016_wsup.pdf">kernels for social media data streams</a>, <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-2095.pdf">quality estimation for machine translation</a>, providing recommendations for Google Docs users during my internship at Google Research, modeling information diffusion in social networks during my internship at Max Planck Institute (MPI), and <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2016.00140/abstract">statistical analysis for biology applications</a>.
</p>
<p>
In my work I focus on investigating and developing machine learning models: neural networks, Gaussian Processes, point processes.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Background</h4>
I graduated with MSc degree in Computer Science at University of Warsaw (2012) and with BSc degree in Mathematics at University of Warsaw (2013). 
Prior to that, I graduated with BEng degree in Computer Science at Warsaw University of Technology (2010). <br />
